 Post svn Changelog:
 ===================

 * (trunk) -- Version 0.4 alpha by Daniel Werner
   - The loops count now counts per parser instance. Before there were several hacks to reset the
     counter, for example including an special page in wikitext. This has been solved now.
   - Compatbility to Variables Version 2.0.
   - Configuration variable '$egLoopsDisabledFunctions' to disable certain Loops parser functions.
   - If 'Variables' extension is not active, '#loop', '#forargs' and '#fornumargs' will be disabled.
   - Language file clean-up.
   - Internal structure changed, ExtLoops now works as a static class.
   - '#fornumargs' parameter 1 can be empty to make it more consistent with other Loop parser
     functions. E.g. '{{#fornumargs: | keyVarName | valVarName | code }}' istead of
	 '{{#fornumargs: keyVarName | valVarName | code }}' (which still works as well).
   
 * November 15, 2011 -- Version 0.3.2 by Daniel Werner
   - Bug solved where '#loop' didn't create variables with name or starting index '0'.
   - minor '#forargs' and '#fornumargs' bug solved where unnamed numeric argument values
     could have ended up as variable value with leading space.
   - 'README' and 'RELEASE-NOTES' files added.
   - Put into mediawiki.org svn repository.
